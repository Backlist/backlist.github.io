On November 16, 1532, Francisco Pizarro and as few as 160 Spaniards captured an Inca prince named Atahualpa, killed over 2,000 of his men, and conquered an empire that united the Andes Mountains of South America, from southern Colombia to northern Chile. The conquistadors called this kingdom Peru.  In the decades following, its silver transformed Spain from a crusader kingdom with pretensions of re-taking Jerusalem from the Turks to history’s first global empire. And because of Pizarro’s sword, his harquebusiers, and a mystery illness that had laid Atahualpa’s father low. As you may have read: Guns, Germs, and Steel.

Or not. Historians and anthropologists tend to bristle at such an easy and inevitable version of the events that placed Peru under Spanish control. The following eight books tell a different story, at once more exciting and more tragic. Their most important lesson is this: although European weapons and disease were indeed crucial to giving the conquistadors’ a head-start, that advantage disappeared when ranked against the Incas’ reach and numerical advantage. To explain how the Spanish conquered the Incas, they instead credit the alliances made with the many Indian groups discontented with Inca rule, as well as alliances made with Incas themselves, including Atahualpa. Those alliances then became the foundation of an incredible colonial society, surprisingly just, suddenly violent, that lasted for nearly three hundred years—almost twice as long as England’s colonies in North America.

What emerges is a conquest that was far from simple; that ended not in 1532 but in 1572; that killed almost all of its supposed victors long before it was over; that left the Inca royal family and their sacred cult of imperial dead intact longer than nearly any other New World empire; that led the people of the Andes and some Europeans to consider what past historians thought unthinkable: the return of the kingdom to its now-Christian indigenous lords.

The following books aren’t about the defeat of the Incas, per se: they are about the creation and survival of Peru.

<!-- Hemming, Conquest of the Incas -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta d821c5a3ef29dec4 %}
{% book_capsule For nearly fifty years, this has been one of the best narrative histories ever written, full stop. Richly synthesized, it begins with Cajamarca and goes into wonderfully written detail of the forty year resistance led by Atahualpa’s younger brother Manco and his sons, who tried to stay politically and religiously independent of Spanish rule. %}

<!-- Lamana, Domination with Dominance -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta f0a1ad725afcde63 %}
{% book_capsule Ignore its jargon. This is an absolutely fascinating book on how Andean expectations shaped the conquest. It pulls apart the conquistadors’ contradictory accounts to show why military supremacy did not translate into cultural domination; why Incas ruled in Cusco for a quarter-century after 1532; and how Spaniards struggled to understand why war could only be waged on full moons. %}

<!-- Spalding, Huarochiri -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta 0fc4b3f92c2a6936 %}
{% book_capsule The Incas were conquerors too. How did they compare to the Spaniards, judging from the experience of Indians who weren’t rich and powerful? The modern social history of the Andes begins here, as Spalding plumbs Peruvian archives to show how Spanish rule constricted the wealth, health, and land of groups already living on the edge. %}

<!-- Prescott, History of the Conquest of Peru -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta 2fc95e2aaa5e0217 %}
{% book_capsule Until Hemming, Prescott’s rollicking account of the conquest reigned. It had its problems.Whereas Jared Diamond gives too much credit to ‘guns, germs, and steel’ as an explanation, Prescott leans on ‘God, Gold, and Glory,’ and nearly-innocent Incas rapidly, tragically, outclassed by Spanish villains. But its use of original sources was innovative for its time, and its writing is justly famed. %}

<!-- Ramos, Death and Conversion in the Andes -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta 0a26df4b0847a28a %}
{% book_capsule Not every Inca or Indian could be a cover rebel, secretly worshipping the sun and old religious icons. In looking at why Indians after the conquest buried themselves in churches and wrote wills in Spanish, Ramos explains how they navigated a new political landscape. This is the story of how Peru’s Indians came to believe themselves more Christian than the Spanish. %}

<!-- Mumford, Vertical Empire -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta 6d6422c6c18ff0cb %}
{% book_capsule The dividing line between the Peru of the Incas and the Peru of the Spanish lies not in 1532 but 1569, when the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo arrived, executed the last independent Inca, and resettled over a million Indians to maximize the colony’s silver for Spain. But this revisionist history argues that Toledo’s reforms preserved as much as they dismantled. Many indigenous communities who still exist today date their legal foundation to this moment. %}

<!-- Titu Cusi Yupanqui, How the Spaniards Arrived in Peru -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta 09a5262dfddf4acc %}
{% book_capsule It was Titu Cusi’s younger brother Tupac Amaru that Toledo executed when he arrived. A few years before, while ruling their jungle kingdom east of Cusco, Titu Cusi dictated a message that he hoped would stir the conscience of the Spanish king. It arrived too late to make a difference, but this sad letter from one emperor to another—thick with injustice and human detail—still cuts to the bone. %}

<!-- Garcilaso de la Vega, Royal Commentaries of the Incas -->
{% bookblock %}
{% book_meta 53c1c16b2878cbfa %}
{% book_capsule The Incas weren’t gone, though. In the early seventeenth century, the son of an Inca princess and a conquistador published this history of his mother’s people, of the greatness that he believed the Spanish had misunderstood. Composed a half century after leaving Peru, some of Garcilaso’s memories are a little too golden. But their beauty has been translated and re-published many times since. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries inspired Indians and Spaniards alike to take up arms again, in the name of an Inca kingdom, or republic, reborn. %}
