        <title>List: Museum Histories</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Historians generally agree that museums manifest expressions of colonial scientific enterprises evolving over time. Growing to include millions of objects—including human remains and culturally and spiritually sensitive objects—civic museums in the United States and Europe by the mid-twentieth century had become, for a time, among the most important cultural centers worldwide. This list highlights books exploring how these museums grew to have many of the most important anthropological collections on the planet and how Eurocentric museum practices spread into non-Western places, especially in regions where colonial influence proved strong.</p>

        <title>List: The History of Asian Migrations</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This list merely skims the surface of the rich scholarship on Asian migrations, offering a starting point for curious readers. The books and memoirs here tell many stories—of the mass mobilization of Asian labor for colonial development, the intimate encounters between migrants and immigration laws, the social histories of diasporic communities, and their sense of alienation and negotiated belonging in new, foreign places.</p>

        <title>List: The History of North American Slavery</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Historians of the United States have written and argued more about American slavery than about nearly any other subject, and yet scholarly interpretations of slavery have changed drastically over the course of the last century.  This list does not purport to provide even a smattering of what most scholars would consider the most important works on the subject. But collectively, they hint at where the field has been, demonstrate some of its contemporary evolution, and provide room for the voices of both people who experienced enslavement and artists who have imagined it in especially powerful ways.</p>

        <title>List: Global Histories of Identification and Surveillance</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Never before have our personal identities been scrutinized as they are today. In an age of increasing anxiety and concern for security—especially since 9/11—we are asked to authenticate our personal features on a daily basis, sometimes inadvertently. These books force readers to confront their beliefs and concerns about security and privacy, and make them think twice the next time they look at a camera, type their passwords, or get a new ID card.</p>

        <title>List: Off the Silk Road, beyond the Great Game: Histories of Modern Central Asia</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Terms like “Silk Road” and “Great Game” have done a great service in attracting readers to Central Asian history. However, these phrases—both coined by outsiders—have done little to advance an understanding of the societies they describe, one implying an inert timelessness, the other merely a rocky theater for European imperial rivalry. So how can we understand modern Central Asia on its own terms?</p>

        <title>List: The History of the Modern Papacy</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We expect the papacy to prize tradition and permanence. Yet, the papacy we know is to a large extent a product of the modern era. As Jesuit historian John W. O’Malley once claimed, the most salient fact of Catholic history in the last centuries is the “papalization” of Catholicism. How did this revolution happen?</p>

        <title>List: The History of that Supposedly-Fun Caribbean Vacation</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There is nothing timeless about today’s traveling culture. The modern tourism industry stretching from south Florida to northern South America emerged out of a long and complicated history of colonialism, slavery, exploration, and dreams of the exotic. To offer a guide into tourism’s past, this eclectic list of stories challenges us to rethink the meaning of Caribbean tourism.</p>

        <title>List: Histories of the Scientific Revolution</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While most historians are happy to admit something happened to the study of nature between 1400 and 1700, we remain strangely unable to describe exactly what that something was. The maddening maze of qualifications and uncertainties that riddle our thinking and our prose led Steven Shapin to famously proclaim in his 1996 book, _The Scientific Revolution_, “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.” Here are ten more books about the Scientific Revolution—if indeed there is such a thing.</p>

        <title>List: Maps: A Beginner’s Cartography</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Maps locate histories—stories about time—in the geographies where they happened. But they also have their own histories, and their historians have spent the past few decades demonstrating just how complicated cartography can be. Maps aren’t just dispassionate depictions of territory, interpreted in the same, self-explanatory way by everyone who looks at them. In short, they are untrustworthy.</p>

        <title>List: Family and Gender in Modern Chinese History</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Family and familial ties are at the heart of Chinese society and culture, and in reflection, historians have created a robust and thought-provoking body of work on family and gender in China. Social history remains the bread-and-butter of scholarship on China, but recent trends like the history of emotion and history of the body are also making themselves felt. This vibrant literature points us toward a Chinese history where women and gender are a persistent and vital part of what Chinese historians do.</p>

        <title>List: The Cultural Cold War</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Between 1950 and 1967, the CIA and the U.S. Department of State took on writers, artists, musicians, and others as junior partners in U.S. propaganda campaigns. Uncovering the history of this rather unlikely branch of U.S. foreign relations has become a major preoccupation for diplomatic historians. Audra J. Wolfe shares ten books that sort it all out.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The rise and fall of the American working class has led us to tell ourselves stories about the past to inspire us today. But American labor activists have often mythologized the past to no good end. Many of these books seek to strip away the mythology so that we can learn from the past in order to craft a better labor movement in the present and future.</p>

            <p>Contemporary American attitudes about childhood are rife with paradox. We’re convinced that our children are overprotected, yet parents find it impossible to step back from the many protective measures put in place over the past century. Here are ten books that can help you figure out how we came to be so confused about childhood.</p>

            <title>A Last Minute Holiday Gift Guide for Historians and the People Who Love Them</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>‘Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, historians were worrying about all the things they didn’t read or write that year.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can help; if by ‘helping,’ we mean ‘pile on more wonderful things to equally inspire and instill tremendous anticipatory guilt for the New Year.’ Backlist has come up with six last minute gifts for the amateur or professional historian on your holiday gift list that will be sure to make them at least smile, with furrowed brow, as the year’s publishing catalogues flip over.</p>

<p>Please note, though, we’ve avoided putting books on this list for two reasons: that’s what the rest of our site is for, and, if you’re a historian’s gifting relative, chances are that they’ve already checked the book you were thinking about gifting them out from the library, and they have a very, very strong opinion about it. So instead we’re helping you to help them to smile. Because even if history feels pretty unrelentingly dark at times, those of us who read and write about it mostly aren’t. And we love a good joke. Like, ‘Did you hear the one about the hopeful solstice holiday that was commodified by the Industrial Revolution and English bourgeoisie?’</p>

<p>Hilarious. And here are some things to commodify and gift.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=old+book+scented+candle&amp;tag=backlist0e-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=47411772530&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=4416532350766266052&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_3zgqpsywnl_b">Book-Scented Candles</a></strong>: Did you know that you can light your winter with the smell of history? That is, candles that smell of new books, old books, and ancient scrolls, or even particular settings, like mid-nineteenth century American gothic dissolution (Edgar Allen Poe = Cardamom, Absinthe, and Sandalwood). There doesn’t seem to be a candle for Medieval Europe, though, which is probably for the better. Plague, body odor, onions, and incense is a fun candle to imagine; less so to recreate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=reading+glasses&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Areading+glasses&amp;tag=backlist0e-20">Reading Glasses</a></strong>: It’s time to face the inevitable. Your loved one’s love of history? It’s killing their eyes. Right about now is the time of year when lovers of good books and eight-point font footnotes start taking their glasses off, rubbing their eyes with forefinger and thumbs, and worrying about their next trip to the optometrist. Anticipate this (even if that’s something a good historian never does) and give them the gift that keeps them reading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A Premium Information Management Tool</strong>:  The appropriately big ticket item on this list, a premium information management program like <a href="https://evernote.com/?var=1">Evernote Premium</a> or <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink Pro Office</a> is the thing your favorite historian has perhaps been hearing about all year, but has been wary of trying, because their price tags are often steep. For Evernote, in December of 2015, it’s $49.99 per year; for DEVONthink Pro Office, it’s $149.99. But what they can get, if you gift it to them, is tremendous: programs that let them paperlessly organize their reading and notes on books and in archives, and the photos of documents and journals they want to collate and put in dialogue with other texts. They can sync online between devices and, in the case of Mac-only DEVONthink, offer an OCR function that scans photographed documents and makes their printed text searchable. Over time, these programs pay for themselves, making connections between unconnected research trips, and facilitating further writing. As the price-tag suggests, this is not something to buy without consulting with your historian. Each program has serious pros and cons, and there are cheaper and less complex options out there (including versions of these products with less features). But if you want to put a spring in your historian’s step, start the conversation. Because if you don’t explain the Cloud to them, someone else will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.standstand.com/">The StandStand</a></strong>: Santa Claus brought one of our editors this lightweight, portable, beautifully-made standing desk last year, and it’s how she knows she was on his “nice” list. Designed by an academic who understands the toll that endless sitting has on the scholar’s body (insert “discipline and punish” joke here), this portable desk will allow your favorite historian to take her reading and writing work to the porch or the dining room table or even the coffee shop — and to stand while she writes for a change of pace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B006WBPVNW/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20">Bathtub Book Stand</a></strong>: Chances are that your favorite historian already has a book stand. (If not, this blessedly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B000RO6CEC/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20">simple wire one</a> makes a great stocking stuffer.) But do you know what they don’t have and will give them a funny panic attack when they rip open its wrapping paper? A <strong>bathtub</strong> book stand. Give this one with a smile, and a hand squeeze to show you know their pain. Tell them, ‘I know how much you like to multitask, even when relaxing. No one’s expecting you to bring your library books into the bathroom and cause water damage. Just the latest edition of the <em>American Historical Review</em> so that you can get inspired by your historical nemesis’s latest victory.’ Or, to read the next item on the list, if you want their heart rate to go contemplatively down, not up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0679731806/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20">Willa Cather, <em>The Professor’s House</em> (1925).</a></strong>: ‘Avoided’ adding books to this list is not the same as ‘not putting books on this list.’ We make the rules, and we bend ‘em for exceptions as on-point as <em>The Professor’s House</em>, Willa Cather’s 1925 novel about an aging American historian who has spent the last many years of his life laboring on a multi-volume history of the Southwest; who has grown distant from his family; who is haunted by the journal of his one-time protege, who found an abandoned Native American plateau city akin to Mesa Verde, and then saw it lost to looting. That journal’s placement in the novel’s structure is fascinating—Cather described it as turquoise set in silver—and its effects on the life of the professor and his family are hauntingly beautiful. It’s up to you whether Cather’s rendering of the professor’s perception of one son-in-law through the veil of anti-Semitic stereotypes reinforces those stereotypes, or is about anti-Semitism itself. (There’s evidence for both, which hopefully suggests the latter.) But in the biggest, most moving sense, <em>The Professor’s House</em> is a sensitive exploration of aging through work, of families being unmade and remade by unspoken tragedies, and of the possibility of a lost past that breaks your heart, but whose memory maybe saves it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And if they’re looking a little haggard, and need something a little lighter – ok, a lot lighter – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0316070637/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20">Elizabeth Kostova’s <em>The Historian</em></a> works in a pinch. Dracula + Plot Points Hinging on Shockingly Lax Archival Rules = An Apt Holiday Diversion.</p>

<p>Yes, that Dracula. Happy Holidays, and Don’t Forget to Footnote!</p>

        <title>List: The History of Drugs from Ambergris to Zedoary</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>These books range widely, from the Pulitzer-prize winning poet Odell Shepard’s Harry Potter-esque history of unicorns and Marcy Norton’s influential recent academic history of tobacco and chocolate to Alexander and Anne Shulgin’s utterly unique guide to various psychedelics and “entactogens” of their own manufacture. What binds them together is a fascination with that boundary-crossing, protean, and endlessly fascinating class of substances we call “drugs.”</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Oddly, monsters have only recently begun to appear in American historiography, though other disciplines, and in fact other historiographical traditions, have given them much deserved attention. I found few places to start within my own field, especially in the study of modern America. So, I went on a monster hunt.</p>

            <p>China’s current rulers, like some past ones, are fond of saying there is a single unified “Chinese tradition” of reverence for hierarchy and tradition. How is it, then, that history reveals a culture with multiple strands, including ones that extol questioning received wisdoms and turning the world upside down?</p>

            <p>Ari Kelman has selected titles below that offer a glimpse at how graphic books can accomplish things that text-based histories can’t – especially how this sort of work can rely on visual metaphors to drive unusually spare narrative strategies.</p>

        <title>List: The History of U.S.-Cuban Relations</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>How did the United States and Cuba—two nations separated by a mere 90 miles of water—drift so far apart? Why has a country as small as Cuba played such an outsized role in U.S. foreign and domestic politics? Why do the heroes of the Cuban Revolution, by now either long dead or spending their retirement in tracksuits, still hold such power over the American imagination?</p>

        <title>List: The History of Modern India</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In recent years, the kind of objective truth-telling a professional history implies has been roundly contested by those who feel that elites should not be in charge of writing the history of a large and diverse population. The popular history of India is often told quite differently, and as scholars have attempted to bridge the gap between professional and popular history, many have paid more attention to non-elite and subaltern perspectives.</p>

        <title>List: The Conquest of the Incas</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To explain how the Spanish conquered the Incas, we must credit the alliances made with the many Indian groups discontented with Inca rule, as well as alliances made with Incas themselves, including Atahualpa. Those alliances then became the foundation of an incredible colonial society, surprisingly just, suddenly violent, that lasted for nearly three hundred years—almost twice as long as England’s colonies in North America.</p>

            <title>Welcome to Backlist!</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Backlist! A publisher’s backlist contains the books that never go out of print. Ours is a place for collections of books that historians might put on their own backlists—or sort into piles their desks and dining room tables. These are the books historians return to again and again, the books they recommend and assign, the books that model what it means to join active conversations about the past, or to ask a new question. We want Backlist to be like a favorite professor’s office: filled to overflowing with stacks and piles sorted according to how they think about a particular region, theme, or question. And we invite you to look around!</p>

<p>We’re launching Backlist with five expertly curated reading lists on themes ranging from the <a href="/lists/history-of-us-cuba-relations">history of U.S.-Cuba relations</a> to <a href="/lists/graphic-histories-and-memoirs">histories explored in graphic form</a>. We hope you’ll find a book (or several!) that pique your interest.</p>

<p>Be sure to check back frequently; new lists are appearing all the time here at Backlist.</p>
