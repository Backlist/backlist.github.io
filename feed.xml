        <title>List: Histories of Baseball</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Histories of baseball, like military histories and writings about the U.S. founders, attract substantial popular audiences. Yet there is an abundance of well-researched, thoughtful, and exciting writing about baseball history being produced by both traditional academic scholars and writers from other backgrounds. What all these books have in common is a commitment to contextualizing the game rather than just examining what was happening on the field or in the players’ private lives.</p>

            <title>Outside Reading: National Parks</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s installment of “Outside Reading,” we’ve gone all out on the U.S. National Park Service on the occasion of its 100 year anniversary, and in case you missed it last week, Backlist editor and founder Amy Kohout put together a list on ‘<a href="http://backlist.cc/lists/histories-of-american-national-parks">Histories of American National Parks</a>’.</p>

<p>Erik Loomis reminds us that in addition to conservation, the park service in the U.S. has often taken the opportunity to shape shared notions of American history. The Obama administration in particular has used the Antiquities Act to establish national monuments that highlight events previously under-represented in national narratives. Also check out Loomis’s Backlist list on ‘<a href="http://backlist.cc/lists/us-labor-history">U.S. Labor History</a>’.</p>

<p>Book Riot collected 100 books including novels, memoirs, histories, and nature guides related to the parks and monuments maintained by the U.S. National Park Service.</p>

<p>One of the newly designated sites associated with the expanding mission is Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site, and Ari Kelman’s <em>A Misplaced Massacre</em> follows the evolution of efforts to memorialize the 1864 tragedy. Kelman has also contributed a Backlist list on ‘<a href="http://backlist.cc/lists/graphic-histories-and-memoirs">Graphic Histories and Memoirs</a>’.</p>

        <title>List: Histories of Modern Brazil</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As a Brazilian living in the US, Felipe Fernandes Cruz has seen over the past sixteen years a growing awareness about Brazil. The fascination perhaps lies on the fact that while the country itself is becoming more familiar, the story of how Brazil came to be remains a mystery to many Americans, let alone everyday Brazilians – a tale of contradictions within contradictions.</p>

            <title>Secret Ballots ’16: Histories of American Politics</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Backlist is seeking election-season pitches for new lists from graduate students, junior, and senior scholars. <a href="mailto:editorial@backlist.cc">Pitch us</a> your idea for a list (8–10 books on an election-related theme) by September 1!</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2016/Election_Day_1815_by_John_Lewis_Krimmel.jpg" alt="Painting “Election Day in Philadelphia” by John Lewis Krimmel.jpg" /></p>

<p>Every four years, Americans across spectrums of class, creed, and ethnicity go to the polls and vote for a candidate whose presidency, they’ve been promised, will be “historic.” Given the ways that the American past has long been taught, that promise is immediately fulfilled: up until a generation ago, our histories were broken into four year chunks, bracketed by wars, that tracked the rise and fall and rise of our political parties and the white men who led them, and the mostly white, mostly male, voters who put them into office. The last fifty years have fundamentally changed our understanding of that past, however, as American historians – many of them women, many of them black, Latinx, and Asian – have gone back to the archives and made clear all the ways that the history of American political participation is as much one of exclusion as inclusion; as much one of loss as victory; and that every person who casts their ballot – and every woman, person of color, illiterate, or poor person who was denied it – is themselves as “historic” as the individuals who shape American politics in countless other ways.</p>

<p>This fall of 2016, the Democratic and Republican parties are each celebrating their candidates as unlike any past major party nominee for president, while charging that their rivals are trailing disturbing histories of their own. In the hopes of helping to separate the signal from the noise Backlist will present “Secret Ballots”: a series running alongside our regular coverage that will feature scholars’ favorite books, books that distinguish the “historic” that has precedent from the “historic” that represents something truly and powerfully new in American politics.</p>

<p>To that end, we also solicit pitches for lists from historians new to our site. We seek histories of American politics and voting widely defined: not just of presidents or parties or particular elections, but of the groups that fought to vote, that have been denied the vote, that have influenced party politics from beyond the ballot. We’re interested in histories of electoral coverage, histories of technologies that enabled or inhibited particular kinds of democratic participation, and histories of protest. Our plan is that if this three-month experiment in Backlist’s format is a fraction as successful as America’s now-nearly-225 year experiment, it will become a permanent quadrennial feature. So, canvas your bookshelves and <a href="mailto:editorial@backlist.cc">send your candidates to Backlist</a>!</p>

        <title>List: The American Revolution in Unexpected Places</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For most Americans, the mention of the American Revolution can easily bring to mind a slew of notable figures, events, and even regions, such as Boston and its harbor. In recent decades, historians have done much to move past more familiar understandings of the period, often focusing their studies on obscure individuals or settings, but many of these lesser-known subjects still fall within the boundaries of the thirteen British colonies that secured their independence in 1783. The books in the list move beyond the “thirteen colonies” to provide alternative vantage points that help paint a richer, more regionally complex understanding of the American Revolution.</p>

        <title>List: Histories of Peruvian Independence</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Peru achieved its independence in 1824, later than any other mainland Spanish American colony and under the leadership of outsiders like José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar. For decades, historians attributed those facts to a repressive colonial society that had quashed dissent, despite massive rebellions from the mid-eighteenth century on. Since the 1970s, however, other historians have suggested that those rebellions—mostly Indian-led—terrified the country’s white elite, slowing independence’s arrival. The reality was more complex, in large part because of the indigenous Andeans who fought for both sides, for their own ideals of freedom and justice.</p>

        <title>List: Histories of Antarctica</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Antarctica has the shortest human history of any continent on Earth. Despite its short human history and lack of indigenous population, the southern continent has a fascinating historiography. Traditionally, historical interest in Antarctica has focused on exploration, and in particular on the history of the so-called “heroic era” of the first two decades of the twentieth century, but more recent historiography has seen a growth in more critical studies of these expeditions, connections to imperialism and nationalism, and their scientific and literary outputs.

        <title>List: Jazz History</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To repeat one of its favorite metaphors, the literature of jazz history is a thick gumbo of perspectives and forms. This list keeps that unevenness and multiplicity in mind, even if it also favors the work of the “New Jazz Studies” of the 1990s and its heirs. Some readers may want chronological perspectives; others to read secondary texts alongside the primary voices. Or _Choose Your Own Adventure_ and look for order in the shuffle.</p>

        <title>List: Catholicism in Modern Mexico</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The books on this list help explain how an imported and imposed religion succeeded, despite attacks by the Mexican state over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, revealing how a diverse, internally fragmented faith was remarkably inclusive and responsive to local realities. The Catholicism portrayed here is historically dynamic, unlike the backwards and monolithic Church depicted by earlier scholars. The books included focus especially on the realm of belief and practice among ordinary people, acolytes of the brown-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe or the miraculous Christ of Chalma, to locate what Pope Francis has called Mexico’s religious “idiosyncrasy.”</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In some way or another, the authors included in this list grapple with the question: How free is free? They ask what it means for a nation that believes itself to be the model democracy to use lynching, segregation, convict leasing, disfranchisement, debt peonage, race riots, and racist caricatures to control black men and women after abolishing slavery. They also ask how Jim Crow disrupted the interior lives of African Americans who survived it.</p>

        <title>List: Histories of Food and Hunger</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here’s the thing about histories of food and hunger: they’re tricky to write because food and hunger are everywhere and nowhere. Food is everywhere in the sense that it often gets mentioned in passing in works of history that don’t focus on food. One could say that food _was_ nowhere as of ten or twenty years ago; only a small number of chronological histories existed—and many of them focused on the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries. More recently, historians have turned their attention to the colonial period and the early nineteenth century, asking questions about race formation, power relations, and environmental changes over time.</p>

        <title>List: Museum Histories</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Historians generally agree that museums manifest expressions of colonial scientific enterprises evolving over time. Growing to include millions of objects—including human remains and culturally and spiritually sensitive objects—civic museums in the United States and Europe by the mid-twentieth century had become, for a time, among the most important cultural centers worldwide. This list highlights books exploring how these museums grew to have many of the most important anthropological collections on the planet and how Eurocentric museum practices spread into non-Western places, especially in regions where colonial influence proved strong.</p>

            <p>This list merely skims the surface of the rich scholarship on Asian migrations, offering a starting point for curious readers. The books and memoirs here tell many stories—of the mass mobilization of Asian labor for colonial development, the intimate encounters between migrants and immigration laws, the social histories of diasporic communities, and their sense of alienation and negotiated belonging in new, foreign places.</p>

        <title>List: The History of North American Slavery</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Historians of the United States have written and argued more about American slavery than about nearly any other subject, and yet scholarly interpretations of slavery have changed drastically over the course of the last century.  This list does not purport to provide even a smattering of what most scholars would consider the most important works on the subject. But collectively, they hint at where the field has been, demonstrate some of its contemporary evolution, and provide room for the voices of both people who experienced enslavement and artists who have imagined it in especially powerful ways.</p>

        <title>List: Global Histories of Identification and Surveillance</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Never before have our personal identities been scrutinized as they are today. In an age of increasing anxiety and concern for security—especially since 9/11—we are asked to authenticate our personal features on a daily basis, sometimes inadvertently. These books force readers to confront their beliefs and concerns about security and privacy, and make them think twice the next time they look at a camera, type their passwords, or get a new ID card.</p>

        <title>List: Off the Silk Road, beyond the Great Game: Histories of Modern Central Asia</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Terms like “Silk Road” and “Great Game” have done a great service in attracting readers to Central Asian history. However, these phrases—both coined by outsiders—have done little to advance an understanding of the societies they describe, one implying an inert timelessness, the other merely a rocky theater for European imperial rivalry. So how can we understand modern Central Asia on its own terms?</p>

        <title>List: The History of the Modern Papacy</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We expect the papacy to prize tradition and permanence. Yet, the papacy we know is to a large extent a product of the modern era. As Jesuit historian John W. O’Malley once claimed, the most salient fact of Catholic history in the last centuries is the “papalization” of Catholicism. How did this revolution happen?</p>

        <title>List: The History of that Supposedly-Fun Caribbean Vacation</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There is nothing timeless about today’s traveling culture. The modern tourism industry stretching from south Florida to northern South America emerged out of a long and complicated history of colonialism, slavery, exploration, and dreams of the exotic. To offer a guide into tourism’s past, this eclectic list of stories challenges us to rethink the meaning of Caribbean tourism.</p>

        <title>List: Histories of the Scientific Revolution</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While most historians are happy to admit something happened to the study of nature between 1400 and 1700, we remain strangely unable to describe exactly what that something was. The maddening maze of qualifications and uncertainties that riddle our thinking and our prose led Steven Shapin to famously proclaim in his 1996 book, _The Scientific Revolution_, “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.” Here are ten more books about the Scientific Revolution—if indeed there is such a thing.</p>

        <title>List: Maps: A Beginner’s Cartography</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Maps locate histories—stories about time—in the geographies where they happened. But they also have their own histories, and their historians have spent the past few decades demonstrating just how complicated cartography can be. Maps aren’t just dispassionate depictions of territory, interpreted in the same, self-explanatory way by everyone who looks at them. In short, they are untrustworthy.</p>

        <title>List: Family and Gender in Modern Chinese History</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Family and familial ties are at the heart of Chinese society and culture, and in reflection, historians have created a robust and thought-provoking body of work on family and gender in China. Social history remains the bread-and-butter of scholarship on China, but recent trends like the history of emotion and history of the body are also making themselves felt. This vibrant literature points us toward a Chinese history where women and gender are a persistent and vital part of what Chinese historians do.</p>

        <title>List: The Cultural Cold War</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Between 1950 and 1967, the CIA and the U.S. Department of State took on writers, artists, musicians, and others as junior partners in U.S. propaganda campaigns. Uncovering the history of this rather unlikely branch of U.S. foreign relations has become a major preoccupation for diplomatic historians. Audra J. Wolfe shares ten books that sort it all out.</p>

        <title>List: U.S. Labor History</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The rise and fall of the American working class has led us to tell ourselves stories about the past to inspire us today. But American labor activists have often mythologized the past to no good end. Many of these books seek to strip away the mythology so that we can learn from the past in order to craft a better labor movement in the present and future.</p>
